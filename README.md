# Arboreal
Arboreal is a crate containing as many data trees as reasonable. Currently, the project maintains a focus on the trees that I (FloralSoda) personally have an interest in, which is often in the context of utility applications, games and simulators.

## Usage
Add this to your `Cargo.toml`:
```toml
[dependencies]
arboreal = "0.1"
```

## Features
None right now! Come back later

## Compatibility
As of yet undiscovered!
This project is built in rustc 1.72.0, and will be tested on this version onwards. 
Should requests be received to guarantee support for older versions, the choice may be made to test on older versions.

## Contributing
Please have either Powershell or Bash installed on your system to run the automated preparation script (build.ps1 / build.sh), which currently runs cargo build, cargo test and cargo docs.

Please create a pull request when you wish to contribute, or add something in the issue tracker if you just want to inform us of a suggestion or bug you found.
